Jan Kremen - Movie Trailer Project
==================================
This project was created as course project during my participation in Full Stack Web Developer course.

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7 or 3.5 installed.

### Run project
1. Clone project repository
2. Run main module.
> python main.py
3. If the browser won't open automatically. Open index.html file in your project browser.

### Changes
I modified fresh_tomatoes module to show movie title and storyline. 
I also changed event listener that trigger function that clears youtube iframe, because click event has been triggered even when the user clicks into modal.
